How the creation of NetWEB came from ?

Basically NetWEB came from within an idea to just easing as much as we can the different situations a user no matter where he is in the world, can be face to with his computer or his networking space.

We realise, too many people are lacking knowledge in terms of basics computer science. Our world is growing and moving more faster than ever and if you want to be part of this world you better keep up in the first wagon. Mostly everything that we using on a daily basis are all connected together or with a wifi connection, or a cabling connection. 

NetWEB still a fictual company, but the idea behind this fake company is the reality of our world.

But at the end, Im trying to use real problematics of our century to improving my coding skills and sharing projects that im truly believing in it and holding deeply on to my heart.
